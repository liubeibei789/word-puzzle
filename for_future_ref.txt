1.must put (char**) and (char*) converter to calloc function.
incorrect:
char **puzzle = calloc(numRow, sizeof(char*));
puzzle[i] = calloc(numCol, sizeof(char));

correct:
char **puzzle = (char**)calloc(numRow, sizeof(char*));
puzzle[i] = (char*)calloc(numCol, sizeof(char));

2. collect the '\0' after each line.
for (j = 0; j < numCol; j++)
{
   fscanf(fp, "%c", &puzzle[i][j]);
}
getc(fp);

3. initialize double pointer.
incorrect:
char** puzzle = {"fhsorapplewoappnapples","aaappleospwappleswapp","woapplawwwsagmml"};
char puzzle[][] = {"fhsorapplewoappnapples","aaappleospwappleswapp","woapplawwwsagmml"};
char puzzle[3][] = {"fhsorapplewoappnapples","aaappleospwappleswapp","woapplawwwsagmml"};

correct:
char puzzle[][30] = {"fhsorapplewoappnapples","aaappleospwappleswapp","woapplawwwsagmml"};
char puzzle[3][30] = {"fhsorapplewoappnapples","aaappleospwappleswapp","woapplawwwsagmml"};

this works best:
char** puzzle = (char**)calloc(3, sizeof(char*));
   puzzle[0] = "fhsorapplewoappnapples";
   puzzle[1] = "aaappleospwappleswapp";
   puzzle[2] = "woapplawwwsagmml";

4. compiling multiple c files:
given 3 .c files a.c、b.c、c.c：
gcc  a.c  –o  a.o                    
gcc  b.c  -o  b.o
gcc  c.c  -o  c.o
gcc  a.o  b.o  c.o  –o  all  
./all 
(TODO: I am still not clear about how to compile and link multiple c source files)

5. intersection problem
TODO:
I put a logic in finder to deal with two words intersection,
but the character at the intersection is lower in solution....
something wrong here...to be figured out.

6. beforeFinder and afterFinder not symmetric
for the 4 diagonal cases(topleft2bottomright,etc.),
"from rectangle to triangle" and "from triangle back to rectangle", operations are not exactly reverse.
this is strange to me.


7. printing index before manipulating matrix
if logic is complex, print indexes before essential value assignments.

8. look for apis(e.x. strstr()) before writing it yourself.
